z_section
=========

extracts a vertical section of gcode for an extrusion printer

  extract_z_section.pl allows you to pull a section of gcode 
that corresponds to a certain Z axis interval. All Z 
dimensions will be reformated so that the section will print 
on the printbed. This will allow anyone to pickup a failed 
print at a specific layer so that the object can be 
super-glued together.

WARN global variables are in use.
